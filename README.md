# Data Centric Milestone project. 

### As the college have specified-->

#### External user’s goal:
Find and share recipes

#### Site owner's goal:
Promote a brand of cooking tools.

#### Potential features to include:
Create a web application that allows users to store and easily access cooking recipes. Recipes would include fields such as ingredients, preparation steps, required tools, cuisine, etc.

Create the backend code and frontend form(s) to allow users to add new recipes to the site, edit them and delete them.

Create the backend and frontend functionality for users to locate recipes based on the recipe's fields. You may choose to create a full search functionality, or just a directory of recipes.

Provide results in a manner that is visually appealing and user friendly.

#### Advanced potential feature (nice-to-have)
Build upon the required tools field to promote your brand of kitchen tools (e.g. oven, pressure cooker, etc…).

Create a dashboard to provide some statistics about all the recipes.






## The ramblings of a mad man continued below
 
 Cook book advertising a specific set of cooking tools. 
 
 Make a fake company?? // use a real company
 
 Which tools are we going to advertise? Utensils, cooking ware, ovens// pizza ovens
 
###The database. 

Design Data base layout. What will be our primary keys, how will a search function. How do I keep the DB relational.
 
### To do...
1. Design Database lay out.
2. Develop routes that will allow the user to have full access to the database. CRUD
3.

#Recipe Hub - Data Centric Milestone Project
The focus of this project is to display the CRUD principle of database orientated software development and design. 

##UX
The goal for the UX of this project was to keep the general layout straightforward and easy to use. 
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

#### User Stories
"As an avid cooking enthusiast, I am looking for a website that is easy to navigate and that allows me to keep recipes I encounter or create all in one easy to manage place."

"As a professional, I would like to be able to view other peoples recipes to take my inspiration from. "

"As a parent, Im stuck for time and want to be able to get to the recipes within a couple clicks without having to navigate through a mountain of options."

"As an advertising partner, I want my site to seem attractive to your end users and for them to be able to get to my site quickly from yours" 

#### Wireframes
Below are the original wireframes that I drew up before I began working on the project. Although the project has changed from these original wireframes,
the general idea has stayed along the same lines. Albeit, with a few differences. As work began on the project these original plans as the same outline and shape 
wouldnt have worked as the general project had to adapt to code that I was writing.

Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Features Left to Implement
Another feature idea
Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
