# Data Centric Milestone project. 

### As the college have specified-->

#### External user’s goal:
Find and share recipes

#### Site owner's goal:
Promote a brand of cooking tools.

#### Potential features to include:
Create a web application that allows users to store and easily access cooking recipes. Recipes would include fields such as ingredients, preparation steps, required tools, cuisine, etc.

Create the backend code and frontend form(s) to allow users to add new recipes to the site, edit them and delete them.

Create the backend and frontend functionality for users to locate recipes based on the recipe's fields. You may choose to create a full search functionality, or just a directory of recipes.

Provide results in a manner that is visually appealing and user friendly.

#### Advanced potential feature (nice-to-have)
Build upon the required tools field to promote your brand of kitchen tools (e.g. oven, pressure cooker, etc…).

Create a dashboard to provide some statistics about all the recipes.
